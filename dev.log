Gloomhaven monster card tray worked out fine with the dynamic generation.
There was a minor measurement error - probably kerf correction expanding the tab holes rather than making them smaller -
which cause the tray parts to connect too loosely so that glue was required.

Next up: Caverna trays, which need tray covers to prevent components getting loose in the boxes.
First part is to implement a lid with corner tabs, next part is to use same/similar corner tabs to
enable stackable trays which will function as "lids" for the lower trays.

Turns out Inkscape viewer does not in fact us the specified viewBox but rather changes to viewbox
to pixel scale. mm to pixel scale is 0.26458

In inkscape 0.92 this can be corrected by setting File > Document Properties > Viewbox : Set the width
and height to the specified Custom Size. Paths should have the right scale then.

Did first cuts with 3.5mm, the accumulating nature of hole
cutting broke when switched from 3 -> 3.5mm. Need to implement absolute
positioning of holes.
