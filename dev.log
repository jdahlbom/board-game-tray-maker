Did a paper proto to get some sane starting values for Caverna animal meeple slots.
Measuring & calculating the outer bounding boxes is useful for starting, actually
building the physical slot with the components is much more assuring.

I had used a minimum height of 30 mm per tray, but the meeples work better with shallower trays.
Seems that the side toothing gets broken by that at the moment. Reduced tooth sizing to minimum of 8mm.

There is still a problem with additional slot getting created even with elastic slot sizing.

Handling the unused column height is a non-trivial problem when spacers can span columns.
One solution might be to precompute available extra space for each slot, and then
use that available extra space to first adjust the almost matching spacers to combine them.

I refactored the most of ht epath generation to use string arrays rather than creating the SVG objects
directly.
This allows better debugging and positioning of elements after first creating all of them, possibly also
using rotation and better packing algorithms. It also makes the path part computing functions more functional
when they do not mutate the inputs.

LESSON LEARNED: Paths must always have a absolute starting position set by "M x y"
- Spacers now support indents, but the last slot index handling is not quite clear.
- Unused column height handling is yet to be done.

The tray outline indentations seem to work no - visual validation and laser cutting should be
done to check that measurements are correct.
Next up:
- The empty column height should be rather distributed to all slots that are allowed
to expand rather than adding an empty column slot which serves no purpose.
- The spacers should also support the indentation if either slot needs it and both sides allow it.
There is no configuration yet for forbidding indentation, that needs to be added.

I have very little idea what I was doing last time I touched this - 2 years ago after the vacation,
before last years huge personal mess.
Right now I have Caverna pieces spread on the table and will try to create enough features
to generate simple trays for Caverna, leaving most fancy ideas for later.

I will want to have multi-tray configuration files to fill the material sheets without manual work.
At the moment the generator works and while I don't remember precisely how, it 
is still something I can build incrementally on.

Gloomhaven monster card tray worked out fine with the dynamic generation.
There was a minor measurement error - probably kerf correction expanding the tab holes rather than making them smaller -
which cause the tray parts to connect too loosely so that glue was required.

Next up: Caverna trays, which need tray covers to prevent components getting loose in the boxes.
First part is to implement a lid with corner tabs, next part is to use same/similar corner tabs to
enable stackable trays which will function as "lids" for the lower trays.

Turns out Inkscape viewer does not in fact us the specified viewBox but rather changes to viewbox
to pixel scale. mm to pixel scale is 0.26458

In inkscape 0.92 this can be corrected by setting File > Document Properties > Viewbox : Set the width
and height to the specified Custom Size. Paths should have the right scale then.

Did first cuts with 3.5mm, the accumulating nature of hole
cutting broke when switched from 3 -> 3.5mm. Need to implement absolute
positioning of holes.
