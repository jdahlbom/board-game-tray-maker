Epilog Fusion M2 laser cutter notes.

- Illustrator imports plain SVG, but doesn't follow the millimeter scale,
  seems to me it converts the units to 96 dpi pixels instead.

- 1 inch = 25.4 mm
- 96 dpi = 96 pixels / 1 inch = 96 pixels / 25.4 mm
- Try correcting with scale 96/25.4 = 3.78

- Width of full spacer item after 378% scaling: 172.288 mm
- Expected value from tray height specification + kerf correction: 129.2 mm

- Width of misscaled piece: 45.58 "mm"
- Expected 129.2 mm
- Corrective scale: 2.8345
- Illustrator defaulted back to 72 DPI, for which the correction scale is 2.8345
