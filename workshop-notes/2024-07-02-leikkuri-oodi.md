Epilog Fusion M2


- Had to add panel margins
- They don't have 3mm plywood until August.
- Trying out MDF 3mm because of the lack of plywood.

Cutting the first 3mm piece on MDF:
- MDF cutting seems fast.
- The laser cutter cuts best in the top left corner and worst in the bottom right,
  some of the MDF pieces were not entirely cut through
- The cursor is possibly in the wrong spot, so the panel got cut 30% to the side,
and I'll hve to redo it manually once I know what to fix.
    - Cursor was wrong because I "File->Open"ed the SVG instead of following instructions
    - Should do "File -> New" and "Import" the SVG on that to get the layout.

Looks like the SVG generation might be correct.

Did not manage to get this done in time during the lab and messed up with lot of other stuff.
It is much better option to just start from scratch with new panels than try and manually
fit stuff on partially used panels.
