Another go at using MDF 3mm + plywood 1mm on Oodis Epilog Fusion M2

- Configured the MDF kerf as 0.16mm for 3mm boards.
  - First run with these settings produced 3mm pieces that fit together snugly.
- Previous run had a problem with the lower right corner that is furthest away
  from the starting point. The laser didn't quite cut through, and I had to finish
  the cuts with a precision knife.
  - This time I'm using slightly higher power setting 10/98/10 rathern than 10/95/10
    given in instructions.

- The workshop instructions give a slightly different width for Hairline than what
  I'm using. I tried using mine since it is smaller than the Hairline value
  - That works, so now there is no need to change the line width separately.
- I didn't figure out the scaling issue so everything needs to be scaled up by 378%.

- It took 13:50 to cut out the full 600x600 board of Spirit Island 3mm MDF components.
- Second board took 03:40 and I could use a waste piece that had a suitable leftover spot.
- 1mm plywood is much faster, estimated time is 01:40.
  - Cutting power for 1mm plywood is not high enough, I used the 50/70/10 in the instructions.
  - They are nearly but not quite cut through.

- The spacer indent slots are too narrow: With 1mm spacers the fit is too tight and I managed to
  break off one ear from a spacer.
  - This seems to vary from indent slot to indent slot: The kerf could be a bit smaller,
    but most slots are properly sized.
